# HUB_genes
Identification of the highly connected proteins/genes (hubs) in a network
This script lets you create a network for a given set of proteins/genes using STRING (https://string-db.org/) and igraph (https://igraph.org). In this network, hubs can be identified using several methods, e.g. degree score or eccentricity score. Network can be visualized and saved as a picture.

All you need to do is to check the code of the organism that you are working on using "Organisms" tab on STRING website https://string-db.org. Sample data refere to Arabidopsis thaliana, which code is 3702. Download the current version of protein network data (full network, scored links between proteins) for your organism from "Download" tab on:  <link>https://string-db.org</link>.
